                <h3 class="text-secondary">BIO</h3>
                <p>I have recently pivoted my career path from the Fuels/Chemical industry, to the Software Engineering field.
                    I have a HUGE passion for design as well as a drive to continually learn. This allows me to excel, because
                    I can adjust my knowledge base of languages to precisely what is needed to complete the task at hand.
                    The ability to learn and understand new coding languages quickly assists me with keeping on the cutting
                    edge of the newest and best technologies available. I enjoy learning and finding better, more efficent
                    ways to execute tasks. The feeling you get when you write a piece of code and it fires perfectly is amazing.
                    It's like solving a complicated puzzle where the end result is you get to look at what you've built and
                    show it to the world. To me, coding is a perfect blend of art and engineering.</p>
